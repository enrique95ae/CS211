Linked Lists practice!  

We create two classes:  
  Node: which contains the information regarding a physical person.  
  LL: Which will be the total of nodes together.  
  
  
Is a simply linked list. This means each node only points to the next one but not to the previous.   
Once the list has been traversed to the end we need to set the pointer back to the HEAD of the list to travers it again. 

The Linked List class (LL) has the following methods:

append(string, string, string);  
insertAtBeginning(string, string, string);  
insertByPos(string, string, string, int);  
print();  
searchByName(string, string);  
updateNumber(string, string, string);  
removeRecord(string, string);  
reverse();
